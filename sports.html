        <h2>Sports I've played</h2>
        <p>I have played softball since I was in 7th grade when I tired out for the middle school team having no experience. In middle school I played mainly first but also got switch from second and shortstop. Going into highschool I was the pitch on Jv and also swung for Varisty. My Somphore, Junior and Senior year I was a starter for Varisty. I started off playing second then moving on the third base.</p>

<p>Recognizing that not everyone can afford a trip to our nation's capital, a team from Google recently created a virtual tour of the White House and included high resolution images of the artwork. Listen to some of the members who worked on the project: </p>

      <p>And here is a video of Michelle Obama describing the virtual tour: </p>

    <p> Your browser doesn't suppport HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="whitehouse.mp4"> link to the video</a> instead. </p>

   <p> Although this is a great resource to virtually explore the White House, there's still nothing quite like being there in person. By visiting our nation's capital, we can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of our nation and its fascinating history. Be sure to check out our monthly <a href="special.html">special page</a>, where trips to Washington DC begin at <s>$799</s> $699. </p>
