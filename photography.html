      <h2>Pictures taken throughout highschool </h2>

<p>I've alwayed loved taking pictues ever since I was little. I usually do it as a hobby if I have time. In highschool I've also taken classes were we had to take pictures as project.</p>

<p>Some of these projects consisted of the downtown dayton building and the graffiti run down barn inbetween the fence which was included in our "ugly and everyday" project. Another project was "perspective" which included the tree reflection upside down in the water.  </p>

<p>In fact, it could take days just to see what the Smithsonian Institution has to offer. Not only are there 19 different museums and galleries, but also the National Zoo. It's the world's largest museum and nearly everything (including the zoo) is completely free!</p>
